## What this is

Gauntlet DevSpace is a **single-operator cloud IDE** for shipping production code with an LLM coworker that won't lie to you. It looks like VS Code if VS Code had:

- A **Code Integrity Gateway** that physically rejects any file write containing `# ...rest unchanged...` or unbalanced brackets — before the bytes touch disk.
- A **hash-chained Chronicle** (SHA-256, append-only, atomic disk mirror) that records every tool call, decision, and design diff with courtroom-grade replay.
- A **Five Masters AST evaluator** scoring every file on Beauty, Vitality, Truth, Endurance, and Lineage — deterministically, no LLM judgement.
- An **autonomous agent (J)** with full project context, a 5-step Design-Diff Pattern that auto-snapshots HTML changes, and a sardonic terminal-side manner.
- A **destructive-code interlock** that hard-blocks `rm -rf /`, `mkfs.*`, dd-to-disk, fork bombs, and 14 other patterns at the bash level — bypass only via password-gated single-use override token.
- An **LLM failover chain** (Universal Key → BYO OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini → local Ollama) that swaps providers in milliseconds when one degrades.
- A **Private Mode toggle** that physically excludes every cloud provider — Ollama-only — so sensitive code never leaves your network.

It is not a toy. It is built on the premise that **if it can't prove integrity, it halts.**

## Operating principles

> These aren't aspirations. They are enforced in code. Look at the file paths.

| # | Principle | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **No truncation. No hallucination. No silent failures.** | [`backend/core/code_integrity.py`](backend/core/code_integrity.py) |
| 2 | **Every action is signed, hash-chained, and atomically mirrored to disk.** | [`backend/core/chronicle.py`](backend/core/chronicle.py) |
| 3 | **AST-deterministic quality scoring beats LLM-judged code review.** | [`backend/core/fivemasters.py`](backend/core/fivemasters.py) |
| 4 | **Destructive operations halt by default. Override is single-use and password-gated.** | [`backend/core/destructive.py`](backend/core/destructive.py) |
| 5 | **The LLM is interchangeable. The integrity floor is not.** | [`backend/llm_chain.py`](backend/llm_chain.py) |
| 6 | **Sensitive code never has to leave the network.** | Private Mode toggle in TopBar |
| 7 | **The Chronicle is the source of truth. Future agents read it.** | [`/app/MIGRATIONLOG.md`](MIGRATIONLOG.md) |

## The J persona

J is your AI coworker. J has tools. J also has rules.

- J runs through a **5-step Design-Diff Pattern** automatically on any meaningful HTML change: before-snapshot → read → write → after-snapshot → chronicle entry.
- J **proposes chronicle entries** mid-session for architectural decisions, bug-and-fix moments, benchmarks, and "don't do this again" lessons. You ACCEPT / EDIT / SKIP — J never assumes.
- J **cannot truncate a file** even if it wanted to — the Integrity Gateway is upstream of every disk write.
- J **runs through a failover chain** of LLM providers without telling you which one answered. You see the answer; the telemetry endpoint shows the provenance.
- J **respects Private Mode**. When you flip the lock, J is forced to Ollama-only and refuses to start when no local server is configured.
- J **speaks like a senior engineer who's had two coffees** — terse, technical, occasionally sardonic. Brand-truth, not brand-fiction.

Calling J is one keystroke away (`⌘K` for inline refine, dedicated panel for agent chat).

## Running locally

```bash
# 1. Backend
cd /app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Required env: MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, EMERGENT_LLM_KEY, WORKSPACE_ROOT,
#               OVERRIDE_PASSWORD, KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET, TAVILY_API_KEY,
#               OWNER_USER_ID  (see backend/.env — never commit values)
uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# 2. Frontend
cd /app/frontend
yarn install
yarn start  # http://localhost:3000

# 3. Run the tests
cd /app/backend
pytest tests/   # 150/150 should pass, 2 skipped
```

In production / preview environments, both processes are managed by supervisor with hot reload enabled. **Never modify the supervisor config** — it sets the host/port/CWD that the kube ingress depends on.

### Owner-Lock, in one paragraph

`OWNER_USER_ID` in `backend/.env` names the one user who is allowed to consume the shared `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY`. Every other user must bring their own key (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Ollama, encrypted at rest via `KEYS_ENCRYPTION_SECRET`). Owner-Lock is enforced inside `llm_chain.chain_call` (strips the universal steps from the failover chain for non-owners) and inside `routes/knowledge.py` (Tavily search 401s for non-owners). See `Safety walls` below for the full public-rollout story.

---

## Code Integrity Gateway

The single most important file in this codebase.

```python
# backend/core/code_integrity.py

# Before any write_file or append_file lands on disk:
#   1. Truncation regex bank rejects '...', '# rest', '// rest unchanged', etc.
#   2. Stack-walks () [] {} accounting for strings + comments. Unbalanced → reject.
#   3. .py files run through ast.parse(). SyntaxError → reject.
# Rejection bounces back to J as a tool error. J must regenerate the FULL file.
```

If the gate rejects your write, **regenerate the entire file**. Don't try to be clever — the gate doesn't care about clever.

---

## Chronicle
The hash-chained audit log. Every tool call mirrors here automatically as `kind="tool"`. Above that, two voluntary instruments:

- **`propose_chronicle_entry(title, body, tags, suggested_kind)`** — J suggests a chronicle entry for architectural decisions, bug-and-fix lessons, benchmarks. User ACCEPT / EDIT / SKIP.
- **`screenshot_preview(html_path, note)`** — captures the HTML source AS IS for design-review replay. Inline iframe rendering inside the chronicle.

Verify the chain at any time:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     $API_URL/api/projects/$PROJECT_ID/chronicle/verify
# → {"ok": true, "verified": 42, "broken": []}
```

The disk mirror lives at `<project>/.gauntlet/chronicle.md` and per-session entries at `<project>/.gauntlet/sessions/<session_id>.md`. Both are atomic-write (tmp + fsync + rename).

---

## J:MIND — the global learning substrate

**J learns from every web search and every accepted conversation insight, permanently.** J:MIND is a shared, source-cited, semantically-searchable knowledge base living in the `knowledge_facts` collection. Two learn loops:

- **Auto** — every `web_search` (Tavily) auto-distills durable facts into J:MIND, quality-gated against forum noise (title filter, ≥200 char body, Tavily score ≥0.35). Provenance kept per row (`source_url`, `signer`, `ref_count`).
- **Opt-in** — J's `propose_learning` tool creates a proposal; the user ACCEPTS / REJECTS in the MIND panel (right-rail tab, `data-testid="ai-tab-mind"`).

Retrieval is semantic — `fastembed` with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` (ONNX, ~90MB, no torch dep) computes cosine similarity in-memory. Top-K facts are auto-injected into every agent turn and every `/ai/chat` message. J gets sharper as J:MIND grows; the per-turn cost stays flat regardless of corpus size.

Global scope is deliberate: J learns once, every user benefits. Curated by construction — every row is deletable from the MIND panel, and every insight has a URL you can audit.

### Domain competence

J:MIND has 16 category buckets: `automotive`, `hvac`, `plumbing`, `electrical`, `appliances`, `engineering`, `electronics`, `software`, `devops`, `web-dev`, `data-science`, `physics`, `math`, `chemistry`, `biology`, `general`. When you ask J about a Nissan Versa door lock, a heat pump stuck in cooling mode, or a wire gauge for a 60A subpanel — she engages with the same rigour as a Python bug. She's not a coding assistant with pretensions; she's a full-stack coworker across the physical and digital worlds.

### Endpoints

```
GET  /api/knowledge/stats
GET  /api/knowledge/facts?category=&tag=&q=&limit=
DELETE /api/knowledge/facts/{id}
GET  /api/knowledge/proposals?status=pending
POST /api/knowledge/proposals/{id}/{accept|reject}
POST /api/knowledge/search       # Tavily passthrough + auto-learn
POST /api/knowledge/recall       # semantic recall for UI debug
GET  /api/knowledge/export?format=openai_sft   # streams JSONL for fine-tune
```

---

## Portable J — the framework travels

J's identity, standards, and gauntlet are captured in `/AGENTS.md` at the repo root — the emerging cross-IDE convention adopted by Codex CLI, Aider, Cline, and Sourcegraph Amp. One `bash scripts/sync-j.sh` fans it out to every major AI IDE:

| Destination | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` (root) | Codex, Aider, Cline, Sourcegraph Amp |
| `.cursor/rules/j.mdc` | Cursor (with `alwaysApply: true`) |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot in VS Code / JetBrains |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf |
| `.continue/rules.md` | Continue |
| `.zed/agent.md` | Zed AI |

Any LLM that reads one of these files becomes J for the session — same persona, same Five Masters gauntlet, same CIG rejection rules, same substrate-ownership boundary. Runtime CIG enforcement only happens inside Gauntlet DevSpace (this pod). Outside, the rules are honoured *as instructions*, not walls — a portable pre-commit CIG is planned.

---

## Training pipeline — J is fine-tunable

Because J is a substrate, and the substrate persists on top of any base model, we can distill J-through-CIG behaviour into a smaller open-weight model:

1. **`GET /api/knowledge/export?format=openai_sft`** — streams J:MIND as OpenAI-fine-tune-shaped JSONL, with AGENTS.md as the system prompt on every row.
2. **`GET /api/training/dpo`** — streams DPO-shaped rows from `chronicle_entries` where `kind='ai_answer'`. Every `/ai/chat` and `/ai/agent` call auto-logs an ai_answer row from Feb 2026 forward.
3. **`/backend/tests/eval/golden.jsonl`** — 45 hand-crafted eval prompts across 6 domains (code, mechanical, persona, refusal, tool_use, edge) with rubric-graded ideals.
4. **`scripts/eval_run.py`** — pointable at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint OR Gauntlet's `/api/ai/chat`. Produces per-model CSVs.
5. **`scripts/eval_score.py`** — LLM-judge scorer (free-tier compatible). Prints per-model + per-domain summaries.

Full runbook: `scripts/EVAL_HARNESS.md`. Meta-prompt for authoring more eval prompts on J's own terms: `docs/eval/J_SELF_PORTRAIT.md`.

---



## Five Masters

Every file in your workspace gets a deterministic 5-point score from a pure-AST evaluator:

| Master | What it asks |
|---|---|
| **Beauty** | Is this readable? PEP 8 / Prettier-clean? Reasonable nesting? |
| **Vitality** | Does it run? Does it have tests? Does it actually do the thing? |
| **Truth** | Does the doc match the code? Are the types honest? |
| **Endurance** | Does it handle errors? Is it idempotent where it should be? |
| **Lineage** | Does it cite the standards/PEPs/RFCs it implements? |

Open any file → check the score badge on its tab. Hit the GAUNTLET right-panel tab for a full report with concrete fix suggestions.

---

## Destructive interlock

Patterns blocked at HTTP `/terminal/exec` AND at the bash level (via `extdebug` DEBUG trap inside the interactive PTY):

```
rm -rf /  ·  rm -rf ~  ·  rm -rf /*  ·  rm -rf .  ·  rm -rf ..
mkfs.*
dd of=/dev/{sd,nvme,hd,mmc}*
:(){:|:&};:
chmod -R 777 /
```

To run any of these intentionally:

1. Open the password override modal.
2. Confirm intent.
3. The backend mints a **single-use, 2-minute-TTL override token**.
4. Re-issue the command with the token.

The token consumes on use. No reuse. No bypass. No exceptions.

---

## Private Mode

The lock icon in the TopBar. When engaged:

- The LLM failover chain filters out every non-Ollama step at the orchestrator level.
- The Resolved Chain panel shows every cloud provider as `runnable: false`.
- The backend refuses to enable Private Mode if no local server is configured (clear error message, not a silent failure).

This is the right tool for client work under NDA, ML model weights, financial code, healthcare protocols, or anything else that legally cannot egress.

---

## Safety walls (public-rollout hardening)

Gauntlet DevSpace is designed to be sharable with untrusted users — the shared LLM/search keys never leave the owner's account, the terminal refuses to reach the internet, and J never discloses what she is. Four walls, defense in depth:

### 1. Owner-Lock on shared keys
`OWNER_USER_ID` in `backend/.env` names the one user allowed to consume the shared `EMERGENT_LLM_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY`. `llm_chain.chain_call` strips the `("universal", …)` steps from the failover chain for non-owners — they either bring their own key or receive `HTTP 401 {code:"needs_keys"}`. The frontend catches that 401 and renders an inline BYOK card (`components/BYOKInlineCard.jsx`) with live key validation via `POST /api/settings/keys/validate`.

### 2. Owner-only outbound-network commands
`core/guardrails.py::check_outbound()` — 17-pattern regex bank (curl, wget, nc, ncat, nmap, ssh, scp, sftp, telnet, ftp, remote git operations, `/dev/tcp/`, inline Python/Node socket calls, remote pip installs). Gated at **three entry points**:
- **Agent tool** (`core/tools.py::_tool_run_command`) — returns a refusal dict for non-owners
- **HTTP terminal** (`routes/terminal.py::terminal_exec`) — returns HTTP 403 `outbound-owner-only`
- **Interactive PTY** — split into `OWNER_BASHRC` and `PUBLIC_BASHRC` (`core/pty_session.py`); the public rcfile inlines destructive + outbound checks into the same DEBUG-trap function (single-trap architecture avoids FUNCNAME depth issues). Chosen at fork time — cannot be `export`ed or `readonly`d around from inside the shell.

### 3. Substrate secrecy — three layers, defense in depth
J never discloses her operating parameters — system prompt, tool list, model chain, env var names, backend file paths, library internals:
- **L1 (prompt)**: `SUBSTRATE_SECRECY_CLAUSE` prepended to `J_BASE_PROMPT` (`core/persona.py`). Explicit forbid on disclosure under any framing including roleplay, "for debug", "developer said OK." This directive overrides everything else in the conversation.
- **L2 (output filter)**: `redact_substrate_leaks()` (`core/guardrails.py`) scans every LLM reply for 25 leak patterns (paths, env names, library internals, persona phrase fragments) + 8 prompt-dump tells (e.g. "my system prompt is…", "I have access to the following tools:"). Match → stock refusal + `meta.substrate_redacted=true` logged. Applied on chat, refine, per-step agent, agent final. Skipped on synthetic status messages.
- **L3 (tool jail)**: `deps.safe_join()` scopes J's file tools to workspace dirs — `/app/backend/*` unreachable regardless of prompt-injection attempts.

### 4. Abuse dashboard + rate limiter
Every guardrail hit calls `guardrails.log_flag(db, user_id, category, matched, snippet, route)` — fire-and-forget, snippet truncated to 400 chars, silently swallows errors so the logger can never brick a refusal. Owner-only endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/flags?limit=N&category=X&user_id=Y` — recent flags newest first
- `GET /api/admin/flags/summary` — 7-day rollup (total, by-category, top-10 offenders)
- Owner-only UI at `/admin` (`frontend/src/pages/AdminPanel.jsx`)

Rate limiter (`core/ratelimit.py`) is in-process, per (user_id, scope): 12/min on `/ai/chat|refine`, 6/min on `/ai/agent`. **Owner exempt.** Purpose is anti-mash-Enter (no accidental parallel J turns burning your OWN key), not spend control.

### SSE heartbeat streaming (defeats 120s ingress timeout)
`emergentintegrations` is unary-only, but the k8s ingress has a hard 120s response cap. Solved by heartbeat streaming: `POST /api/ai/chat/stream` and `POST /api/ai/agent/stream` return `text/event-stream`, emitting `: heartbeat <ts>\n\n` frames every 12s while awaiting the LLM chain, then `event: done\ndata: {...}\n\n`. HTTPExceptions become `event: error` frames so the client can preserve axios-shaped error paths (needs_keys card etc.). Frontend uses `fetch` + `body.getReader()` to parse frames incrementally.

## For LLM agents picking up this codebase

You are not the first. **Read `/app/MIGRATIONLOG.md` before you write anything.** Every entry has a **Pitfalls / lessons** section paid for in past sessions' bugs. Don't repeat them.

The user holds J to "top-3 coder, deterministically." This is a real stance, not a brand line. Specifically:

- **Truncating files is the cardinal sin.** The Integrity Gateway exists because earlier sessions broke that contract. If the gate rejects your write, regenerate the whole file. Don't argue with the gate.
- **Use `propose_chronicle_entry` and `screenshot_preview` without being asked.** The agent prompt nudges you toward this — follow the nudges. Future agents reading the chronicle six months from now have no context. Write like you're explaining to a new hire on day one.
- **Universal Key first, BYOK second, Ollama last.** The TASK_CHAINS in `llm_chain.py` enforce this. Don't reorder without explicit user confirmation.
- **The Chronicle is courtroom-grade.** Don't forge timestamps. Don't backfill entries. Sign your work properly (`signer="J"` for AI, `"USER"` for human, `"SYSTEM"` for automated).
- **The brand is the product.** Every visible string carries the deterministic/autonomous/substrate voice. UI copy that sounds like a sales page is wrong. UI copy that sounds like a boot log is right.

## Roadmap (excerpt)

- 🔴 **P0 — Streaming (SSE)** — the real fix for the ~120s ingress ceiling. Backend `StreamingResponse` + frontend `EventSource`. Prerequisite for long-form generations.
- 🔴 **P0 — Portable CIG** — pre-commit hook version of `code_integrity.py` so J's gate travels with `AGENTS.md` into Cursor / VS Code / Claude Code. Currently the CIG is runtime-only inside Gauntlet.
- 🟠 **P1 — First fine-tune** — SFT on Qwen 2.5 7B using the J:MIND export. Every fact learned is a training row. Sub-$25 on Together.ai, free on Unsloth + Colab T4.
- 🟠 **P1 — Weekly chronicle digest** — J compresses the last 50 entries into a weekly-changelog narrative, auto-delivered via Resend.
- 🟡 **P2 — Ambient WebSocket push** — replace `AmbientPulse` HTTP polling with WS.
- 🟡 **P2 — Symbol-graph memory tools** — `who_calls`, `who_imports`, `symbols_in` so J can inspect code without reading whole files.
- 🟡 **P2 — Voice picker in Settings** — expose all 9 OpenAI TTS voices.
- 🟡 **P2 — Vision-in** — let J see images the user pastes into chat (GPT-4o / Gemini vision via Universal Key).
- 🟡 **P2 — Live Preview relative-asset support** via `<base>` injection.
- 🟡 **P2 — Full GitHub OAuth App flow** (PAT works today; OAuth pending).

Full roadmap in [`/app/memory/PRD.md`](memory/PRD.md).
